# Machine-Learning-project--1
Machine learning algorithm are inevitable in every healthcare industry to detect patient's health is normal or abnormal.
In this project i am going to make a predictive system to detect whether a person has diabetes or not with the help of Machine Learning Model.
REQUIRED TOOLS - Python and its libraries.
Dataset - www.kaggle.com (PIMA Diabetes Dataset).
MODEL - Support Vector Machine Classifier.
Evaluation metrics - Accuracy_score
